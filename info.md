Detailed Project Description
Gran Fondo is a competitive commitment device. It encourages athletes who use Strava, a social fitness tracking platform, to create fitness challenges, stake ETH as an incentive to meet their goals, and then compete for the ETH prizes. The app makes it simple to create or join a fitness challenge, view competitors, and claim your rewards if, and only if, the Strava API proves that you have earned them. The Chainlink integration enables us to pass data between the Strava API and our smart contract holding staked funds.
